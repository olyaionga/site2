      cultural influence in pop music.

      then had a lengthy and widely publicized relationship with rapper <font color="red">Sean "Puffy" Combs</font>.
      In December 1999, Combs and Lopez were allegedly involved in a shooting incident outside a New York City
      nightclub, in which three people were injured. Combs was later charged with gun possession and bribery, as
      prosecutors claimed he offered his driver, Wardel Fenderson, $50,000 to say that the loaded gun police found
      at the scene of the crime was Fenderson's. Combs was acquitted of all charges,and soon confirmed that he
      and Lopez had separated.

      <h2><u>TV Projects</u></h2>
   </center>
   <p><i>'American Idol'</i></p>
   <p align="justify">In 2010, despite being busy with her family and both music and acting projects, Lopez decided to
      enter into a new phase in her career. She announced her plans to replace <font color="red">Ellen DeGeneres</font>
      as the new female judge on the 10th season of <font color="red">American Idol</font>, which had also just welcomed
      Aerosmith's Steven Tyler as part of its celebrity judge panel.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">Lopez returned to the hit reality TV show for its 11th season, earning a reported
      $20 million, almost double what she had made when she first signed on.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">In 2012, Lopez announced that she would be leaving American Idol. "I honestly feel like the time
      has come that I have to get back to doing the other things that I do, that I put on hold because I love Idol so
      much," Lopez told Ryan Seacrest on his morning radio show. Her departure from the show proved short-lived,
      however, as Lopez returned to American Idol for its 13th season, in 2014.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">Lopez also continued to work on her own music, releasing the album <font color="red">A.K.A.</font>
      in June of 2014. Around this time, Lopez also collaborated with <font color="red">Pitbull and Claudia Leitte
      </font> on the song <font color="red">"We Are One"</font> for the World Cup, and went on to work on the 2015
      thriller The Boy Next Door, with Ryan Guzman.
   </p>
   <p><i>'Shades of Blue'</i></p>
   <p align="justify">On the small screen, Lopez joined <font color="red">Ray Liotta</font> on the NBC police drama
      <font color="red">Shades of Blue</font>, playing a corrupt cop who turns against her fellow officers to save
      her own neck and protect her daughter. The show debuted in 2016 to mixed reviews,but found its footing and endured
      for three seasons. Also in 2016, Lopez served as a judge for the final season of the original run of American
      Idol, and delivered the first performance of her
      <font color="red">All I Have residency at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas</font>.
   </p>
   <p><i>'World of Dance'</i></p>
   <p align="justify">Lopez also was active behind the scenes, playing the role of executive producer. In July 2016, NBC
      announced that it would be partnering up with her for a dance competition called <font color="red">World of Dance
      </font>, which offered a $1 million prize for the taking. The show debuted in May 2017 and later was renewed for
      multiple seasons.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">Remaining busy into 2018, the multi-talented entertainer dropped an English-language single,
      <font color="red">"Us,"</font> in February, before following with the Spanish-language
      <font color="red">"El Anillo" </font> and the bilingual <font color="red">"Dinero"</font> in the spring.
      Later in the year, her track <font color="red">"Limitless"</font> accompanied her return to the big screen
      in the rom-com Second Act.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">In early 2019, J-Lo was tapped to deliver a tribute to Motown at the
      <font color="red">Grammy Awards</font>. Although she sizzled with a high-energy performance, she also was
      enveloped in the criticism over whether the Grammys should have selected a Black artist for the tribute.
   </p>
   <p><i>'Hustlers'</i></p>
   <p align="justify">That summer, Lopez showcased a different set of moves as a scheming stripper in Hustlers. It was a
      career-defining performance in the eyes of many critics, and the actress received a
      <font color="red">Golden Globe nod</font> among a slew of nominations, though she was notably snubbed by the
      Academy Awards.
